Bullshit Acronym Generator  
[Live Demo](https://loictouzard.github.io/BAG/web/)

This Project is a website on which you can ask for the generation of a 'bullshit' acronym.  
It only contains words I've seen during my studies in some particular courses (ASI, PLD). That's the reason why many letters have no word corresponding, but also why this is funnily accurate at some points ! :D  

The words are all stored in one file [words.json](web/data/words.json).  


Now I moved on some other projects and developed a npm module called [acronym-generator](https://github.com/LoicTouzard/acronym-generator) that create acronyms with the same algorithm. But this module actually uses a mongoDB database instead of the json file. It also provides function to add and remove word from the database. If you're interested check it out ! :)
